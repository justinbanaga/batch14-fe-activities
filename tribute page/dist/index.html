  </ul>
  

  <h3>Abilities:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Expert Swordsman</b>: Asta initially has a rough style due to having an unconventional sword and having only
      received basic training from Fanzell Kruger.</li>
    <li><b>No Magic Power</b>: Asta possesses no mana and so is unable to use magic.</li>
    <li><b>Enhanced Strength</b>: Asta possesses a high level of physical strength, able to do a thousand single-handed
      handstand push-ups, to swing heavy swords single-handedly, and to punch holes in rock walls with no injury to
      himself.</li>
    <li><b>Enhanced Speed</b>: Asta is capable of moving in an above-average speed, which causes William Vangeance to
      think that he has used magic to aid himself.</li>

      receiving numerous attacks from Heath.</li>
    <li><b>Enhanced Instinct</b>: Asta possesses a heightened level of instinct, as demonstrated when he can unconsciously
      move his body in the best way to defend himself.</li>
    <li><b>Ki</b>: A principle originating from Yami's homeland, Hino Country, this allows Asta to use a sixth sense and
      to perceive and react to unseen attacks and people.</li>
    <li><b>Keen Intellect</b>: Despite his hyperactive and headstrong nature, Asta has shown to be intelligent and
      thoughtful in his own right.</li>
    <li><b>Devil-Possessed</b>: As a wielder of a five-leaf clover grimoire, Asta is connected to Liebe, who possesses
      Anti Magic, which grants him access to this energy.</li>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Unite</b>: After undergoing the Devil-Binding Ritual, Asta forges a contract with Liebe to share power as
        equals, and after training for a couple of days, Asta and Liebe learn to Unite, which greatly enhances their Anti
        Magic abilities.</li>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Asta 「アスタ Asuta」 is an orphan raised under the care of a church in Hage after his mother abandons him on the church's doorstep. After turning 15 years old, Asta receives a five-leaf clover grimoire with an Anti Magic devil inside. He joins the Clover Kingdom's Black Bull squad of the Magic Knights and becomes a 3rd Class Junior Magic Knight and temporarily a Royal Knight.</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Asta generally is cheerful and hyperactive. He tends to shout to express his thoughts and goals, much to the annoyance of some of those around him, and often in spite of other people's opinions. One of the first examples of this is when he conveyed his goal of becoming a Magic Emperor during the Magic Knights entrance exam, and told other people who jeered at him to be quiet. Asta's simple yet outgoing personality is frequently played to comedic effect during more serious situations. However, his strong tenacity interests Yami Sukehiro enough to recruit him into his ranks, and his determination also leads him to possess an indomitable will. Asta's determination to never give up, added with his own steel fortitude during grueling or harsh battles, is a trait that becomes the basis for others to acknowledge him, such as Magna Swing. However, Asta has shown to have struggled accepting his lack of magic, using his boisterous attitude as a front to hide his insecurity. After having his arms broken and cursed by Vetto, Asta nearly slips into a depression before talking and forcing himself to continue pushing onward.</p>
<p>Because of his upbringing in the Forsaken region, Asta frequently receives cruel opinions and insults from almost everyone he meets. To counteract this, Asta appears to have developed a slightly sarcastic nature as he tries to defend himself. The regularity at which he's exposed to such degrading remarks is such that he now has a certain immunity to them, shown when he easily brushes them off without getting overly annoyed. However, Asta can still become irritated when others deeply insult his comrades; he will not hesitate to confront them as he tries to defend his friends.</p>
<p>Asta also has a very strong sense of justice, which is shown during his fight against Heath Grice, as he believes that everyone deserves to be protected. It is also not limited to only his comrades but his enemies as well, as noted when he asks his fellow squadmates to take the unconscious Mars along with them while the dungeon is collapsing. He argues that their mission is only to explore a dungeon as they are not ordered to kill any enemies. Therefore, Asta seems to see the positive side of everyone and never takes an insult too seriously, as seen when he still befriends both Yuno and Noelle Silva even after both had openly looked down on him. Even when Fana is trying to kill him and his allies with all her power, he attempts to reason with her as a means to understand and talk her down from her rage, showing consideration for nonviolent methods of solving conflict. He later continues to do this with the reincarnated elves, despite no success among repeated attempts.</p>
<p>However, Asta also believes that those that have done wrong should work to actively make up for their wrongdoings. He always holds his enemies accountable for their misdeeds, regardless if he has forgiven them or not. He requests that Neige spend time in prison before promising to become his friend. He later demands that the weakened Ladros apologize to and help all the people he has harmed. In another example, he puts Rades into a submission hold during their next meeting, nearly breaking his arm until the latter successfully convinces him that he will use his powers to help the people in the capital rather than for revenge.</p>
<p>His open, friendly, and non-judgmental attitude, indomitable will, and stubbornness has earned him the respect of almost everyone he meets, even nobles such as Klaus and Fuegoleon Vermillion. It has also earned him the affection of numerous girls, though his love for Sister Lily, combined with his somewhat dense personality, has made him largely oblivious of this fact. This love for Lily and obliviousness also make him somewhat chivalrous and non-perverted, as he absolutely refused to try to peek on the girls while bathing at the hot spring.</p>
<p>While an immensely endearing and honest person, who can win over people with his tenacity, Asta can come off as quite stupid to those around him. Asta is not exactly stupid but growing up in an orphanage in the middle of nowhere has left him ignorant of many things that others consider common knowledge and his headstrong nature makes him come across as the stereotypical muscle head with little to no brains. His naivete constantly leads him to blurt out things with little to no tact or care for the situation at hand, and his blind trust of people in the kingdom despite evidence to the contrary has made him very easy to fool, depending on the situation. His trusting, truthful nature has been taken advantage of by the courts and he nearly spoke his guilt without thinking of the consequences while he was on trial. He is also very ignorant about many things in the kingdom and on its functions which Magic Knights should know with most of his squadmates is that he does not know many simple things such as how corrupt the system ruled by the nobles really is which almost cost him and Marie their lives.</p>
